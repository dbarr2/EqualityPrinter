# Equality Printer in Java

The Equality Printer is a Java application designed to evaluate the equality of three input parameters. It checks if the provided numbers are all the same, all different, or neither completely equal nor completely different. Based on the evaluation, it prints one of three distinct messages, making it an exemplary project for understanding conditional logic and string handling in Java.

## Overview

This program's purpose is to demonstrate the use of conditional statements to execute different blocks of code based on the comparison of input values. It provides a clear example of how to handle multiple conditions and make decisions in a program. The Equality Printer simplifies understanding complex conditional logic through a practical and straightforward scenario.

## Features

- **Equality Check**: Determines if all three numbers are equal.
- **Difference Check**: Checks if all three numbers are different.
- **Intermediate State Handling**: Identifies when the numbers are neither all equal nor all different.
- **Descriptive Output**: Prints a message that accurately describes the relationship between the input numbers.
